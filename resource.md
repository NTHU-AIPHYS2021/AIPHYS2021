## Computational Platform

Practical implementation of neural networks requires a computational platform which includes convenient libraries of deep learning elements and operations. When choosing a platform, aspects such as efficiency and scalability for various types of networks, efficient training, usage with various architectures such as GPU/ multiple CPU and seamless usage with cloud services should be taken into account. There are several platforms that support these requirements, such as TensorFlow, Pytorch, Keras, Caffe 2, ONNX, etc.

The material in this course is universal. Network types and algorithms which we will cover can be implemented on various platforms. 

For consistency, we will use the TensorFlow (Links to an external site.) platform with Python throughout the course since it is the most fundamental end-end comprehensive platform. Indeed, many existing codes and examples are in TensorFlow. With a solid knowledge of TensorFlow, you will be able to quickly learn to work with other platforms when needed.

Follow the instructions in the Local Platform SetupPreview the document guide to set up the platform on your computer. For cloud computing, we will use Google's Could Platform.
